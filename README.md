# Street-Mania
A 2D-Car-Game in Python using Pygame interface, basic graphics functions.

Basically it's a single player game which is meant to be played from 3rd person's perspective.

# Methodology
The methodology of this project includes all the user defined functions for entire gaming construct.
Car can be controlled i.e. acceleration and brake using cursors.
Lanes can be changed using left-right cursors.
During game, score keeps on increasing as the car keeps traversing the distance. There's a background music playing(appearing as if music is played in the car). Once the car hits any other vehicle or the extreme left/right ends of road, game overs at that very moment and score is displayed.
